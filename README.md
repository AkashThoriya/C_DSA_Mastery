# C DSA Mastery: The Low-Level Path

Welcome to the **C DSA Mastery** repository. This is a comprehensive, 6-month structured roadmap designed to master Data Structures and Algorithms specifically through the lens of the **C programming language**.

Unlike high-level DSA courses, this curriculum focuses heavily on **memory management, pointers, and hardware-adjacent optimizations**, making it ideal for developers looking to bridge the gap between software logic and system architecture.
